# aws-inspector

Install and manage AWS Inspector agent.

## Usage

Add the recipe to the node or the role files where you want AWS
inspector installed. If you want to remove AWS-inspector from a
particular node, set inspector.enabled attribute to false in the node
file and it will be removed.

    ```
    {
        "name": "aws-inspector.test",
        "chef_environment": "testing",
        "run_list": [
            "recipe[aws-inspector]"
        ],
        "normal": {
            "inspector": {
                "enabled": true
            }
        }
        ...
    }
    ```

## Quality Checks

Foodcritic:
- All foodcritic recommendations followed except that I use symbols
  rather than strings to access node attributes (FC001)

    ```
    $ sudo gem install foodcritic
    $ foodcritic <path_to_recipe>
    ```

Kitchen:
- Use Kitchen to test the cookbook against a real system. Preferably an
  instance machine with Ubuntu or CentOS. Note that in `kitchen.yml`, it
  is necessary to edit `aws_ssh_key_id` and `ssh_key` to point to an SSH
  key pair in your account.

    ```
    $ bundle install
    $ kitchen test
    # =======
    $ sudo gem install test-kitchen kitchen-vagrant
    $ kitchen init
    $ kitchen diagnose --all
    ```

- Running converge
    ```
    $ kitchen converge default-ubuntu-1404
    ```

- I use `zsh` inplace of `bash`. I had to do this to make kitchen work:

    ```
    $ eval "$(chef shell-init zsh)"
    ```
